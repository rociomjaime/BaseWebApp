  <h2>The Technological/Humanitarian Tradeoff</h2>
  <p> In my machine learning class we learned about the bias vs. variance tradeoff when implementing a predictive model. Basically, when designing a model, you have to consider whether you want to it fit your training data really well (bias), or if you want your model to potentially predict for a wide range of possible input values. The image below provides an example, where the model on the left has high variance and the model on the right has high bias. Both hurt the effectiveness of the model.</p>

  <p>In her article, Colleen Carrigan describes what she calls “the false binary between social and technical dimensions of computers.” In tech I’ve observed and experienced what I’d consider to be a tradeoff between humanism and technical pursuance, where emphasizing one insinuates you’re willing to compromise the other. The difference between this tradeoff and the bias vs. variance tradeoff however, is that enthusiasts on both sides will often be in favor of tipping the scale. I attend Smith College, a small women’s liberal arts college, yet I enjoy taking class at UMass, a large coed research University. I am always interacting with a diverse set of people who carry different perspectives on the topic of technical research, yet I observed a pattern among three distinct groups of people: the humanity majors of Smith, my fellow computer science Smithies, and the UMass “brogrammers”.
	To clarify, I have friends within all of these groups, and while I may not always agree with them, I respect them and the passion they have for what they study. I also am not trying to generalize, there are many members of each groups who are well-rounded in their interests and perspective. This is all based on my personal encounters and experiences, and as someone who finds themselves in the middle. However, it’s important to discuss how in the same way that too much bias or too much variance can throw off a model, disregarding one discipline to further emphasize the importance and superiority of the other also results in an unproductive imbalance.</p>

  <p> I start with the fellow Smithies who focus on the liberal arts and humanities. Growing up, my strengths had always fallen under my humanity courses, and though I was good at and really enjoyed English and foreign language, my analytic skills allowed me to make decent grades in math and science. I always felt that my courses that included subjective thinking and discussion were a fun outlet for creative expression, but the nature of the topics also often led to emotional responses that create bias. Because of this, I’m not surprised that some of my peers in the humanities hold very strong opinions that are grounded by their emotional connection to the subject matter, despite their inability (or sometimes just unwillingness) to discuss them pragmatically. I often think of an instance regarding a friend of mine who is an advocate for educational reform. She continuously claims that the only effective solution is revolution -in other words, the only way to fix the system is to completely scrap the one we currently have. I admire her passion and ambition, and as someone who also believes in education reform, I ask how this can be properly implemented without further harming members of the system who are at a disadvantage. It’s a tough question to ask, and I would never expect her as an individual to have all the answers, but the conversation usually ends with “I don’t know” and annoyance at my questions. Another example is a time when a group of friends and I were discussing class at Smith. Having recently learned about [insert Dollar Street] in my machine learning class, I said that in a global context, we were all “rich”, to which one friend who’s a sociology major immediately rebuts that I can’t say such a thing. And when I mentioned what I learned in class and how quantitatively and objectively speaking, we all had at least some privilege, I was brushed off. </p>

  <p>  On the flip side, the friendships and partnerships I’ve created at UMass exposed me to the other extreme of the trade off, where the scale is heavily tipped in favor of technological/developmental priorities. This means that my colleagues are really good at the technical aspect of the work they do, especially because they attend a top 20 school for computer science, however they disregard the humanitarian and social impact of their work. I believe that part of it stems from arrogance and the hierarchy Carrigan mentions in her perspective, but another component is the lack of diversity in the UMass computer science department. There are few non-cis males in the department, and even fewer under represented minorities, so these viewpoints aren’t added to the mix of the university's CS culture. The harm done here, is that it’s not sufficient for a product to simply <i>work</i>. A project gains most purpose when its impact benevolently reaches outside the screen and deeper than the surface. Product design applies to the big picture, yet many programmers look down on the people who focus their careers to helping a company navigate its presence in a society that is becoming more reliant on technology. This work is deemed as not requiring the intelligence perhaps needed to program the devices and platforms we use, which I find to be laughably hypocritical. Many programming jobs entail simply writing code by following a provided set of tasks, not requiring a deep understanding of why the project must be implemented a certain way. How can you truly understand the product your creating if you don’t have an idea of how its use will manifest when its actual made available to users? How does only working in the social aspect of a product show any less competency than being a code monkey?</p>
	<p>  The computer science environment at Smith provides something unique, which is the fact that most of us are women, and we are learning in classrooms filled with majority women, and nearly all of our TAs are women. The department has its own room for improvement, however an advantage I’ve observed is how Smithies use our technical skills and liberal arts curriculum to answer questions that a homogenous team of males may fail to address. I feel that a large part of the reason why we are able to balance sociological and technological methodologies is because we are allowed and even encouraged to do so. For example, towards the end of March the Five Colleges held the annual DataFest competition, where a dataset is revealed and the teams have two days to analyze and share the findings. This year’s data was donated by the women’s Canadian Rugby 7’s team, and Smith teams won 7 out of the 9 available prizes. The team who won the grand prize presented their findings on the comparison between each player’s reported fatigue and their actual game performance, and then used the findings to argue that it’s important to trust a player’s judgement on her own wellbeing. When handing out the prizes, the judges specified what they liked about the winner’s presentation, and words that always came up included “insightful”, “interesting”, and “detailed”. Another group (from Mount Holyoke) won a prize for breaking down the playing time for a specific player on the team against their mood for each game, and the graph they created wasn’t fancy (everyone was limited on time) but the judges felt that the information presented was interesting. The reason Smithies and Moho students do so well at Datafest is because in order to win, the judges are less impressed by the intricacies and complexity of models performed on the data, and more interested in the story each has to tell with the information given. The Smith professors who help organize the event even tell us this in advanced. So as Smith students we are given the advantage of having these technical skills but also knowing how to utilize them in context of a larger picture, and I feel that our success verifies that having a balanced tradeoff between the humanities and tech results in better performance.</p>
